# libdna - Python API

The aim of this project is to unify functionality commonly found in bioinformatics projects working on DNA. DNA, as opposed to RNA or amino acid sequences, are very long strings. Even bacterial genomes are easily a few megabyte in size. Thus, for efficient analysis the length has to be taken into account in the design of routines.

This is the Python API with similar functionality as the C funtions. Support is experimental and may change in the future.
